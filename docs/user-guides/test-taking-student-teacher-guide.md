## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "No Tests Assigned"
**Reason**: Teacher hasn't assigned any yet
**Solution**: 
- Ask your teacher if they uploaded vocabulary
- They need to generate tests and assign them to your classroom
- Check back in a few minutes

### "Can't Click 'Finish Test'"
**Reason**: You haven't answered all questions
**Solution**:
- You'll see warning: "You have X unanswered questions"
- Go back and answer missing questions
- Yellow warning box tells you exactly how many you missed

### "Got Answer Wrong But I Know It's Right"
**Reason**: Exact spelling required (case-insensitive)
**Examples of answers that are WRONG**:
- Typed: "apple" | Correct: "Apple" ✓ (Case doesn't matter - will be marked correct)
- Typed: "appl" | Correct: "apple" ✗ (Spelling must be exact)
- Typed: "  apple  " | Correct: "apple" ✓ (Extra spaces okay)

### "My Progress Disappeared"
**Reason**: Refreshed page or closed tab
**Note**: Test in progress needs to be completed - don't lose your work!
